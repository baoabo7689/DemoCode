Adding component scripts to implement interactive functions
Scripting development using dynamic language support, you can use JavaScript to develop games,
quickly preview and debug on physical machines and devices, and update your published games.
TypeScript is also supported and can be mixed with your JavaScript code at the same time.


Packages folder is used to place custom extensions for this project.
If you need to install the extension manually, you can create this folder manually.
If you need to uninstall the extension, delete the corresponding folder in packages.

Open your project in Cocos Creator, and choose Developer -> VS Code Workflow -> Install VS Code Extension from main menu.
Let's run VS Code, and choose File -> Open... from main menu, then select your project's root folder and click Open.
Now you can create a new script or edit existing script and enjoy autocomplete and syntax highlight.

To use VS Code as the default editor, open the properties menu (on Mac it’s under CocosCreator). On the left hand side select the “Data Editor” path. There you can change the External Script Editor to be VS Code. Creator will now use VS Code when you click on scripts.
If you look in the developer menu, there’s a VS Code workflow menu, I believe the first option puts the creator.d.ts file in the proper spot for Intellisense.
